        <h3>Who is Grazia Deledda?</h3>
        <p>Grazia Maria Cosima Damiana Deledda (<time datetime="1871-09-28">28 September 1871 – <time datetime="1936-08-15">15 August 1936) was the first Italian woman to receive a Nobel Prize in 1926 and the second Italian Nobel Prize for Literature, 20 years after Giosuè Carducci.</p>
        <p>Her writings, considered an important rapresentation of the currents of verism and decadentism that heavily influenced the literary currents of her years, narrate the harsh struggles and the peculiar elements of her own territory, Sardinia, combining imaginary and autobiographical elements. Her novels tend to criticize social values and moral norms rather than the people who are victims of such circumstances.</p>
        <p>She believed that life was beautiful and serene, unaltered by personal suffering; man and nature are reconciled in order to overcome physical and spiritual hardships. Her later works show how mankind and faith in God are beautiful things.</p>
        <p>While usually disregarded as a feminist writer, Deledda portrays perfectly the pain and suffering of the women of her time and with her own story of constant clash with the traditional role of the sardinian woman, represent as a matter of fact an important influence of the emancipation of sardinian women.</p>
        <blockquote>"Them? [the masters] They're like the wooden saints in churches. They watch, but don't see: evil does not exist for them."

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Grazia Deledda was born in Nuoro from a middle-class family, as the fifth of seven children.</p>
        <p>She had no chance to get an advanced education, and later she took a few private lessons in French and Italian because her family spoke only Sardinian at home. </p>
        <p>At only thirteen she wrote a whimsical but tragic short story, «Sangue Sardo» (1888) [Sardinian Blood], which she succeeded in publishing in a Roman newspaper. The people at Nuoro did not at all like this display of audacity, since women were not supposed to concern themselves with anything but domestic duties. But Grazia Deledda did not conform; instead she devoted herself to writing novels: first, Fior di Sardegna [Flower of Sardinia], published in 1892; then La via del male (1896) [The Evil Way], Il vecchio della montagna (1900) [The Old Man of the Mountain], Elias Portolú (1903), and others with which she made a name for herself.</p>
        <p>In the same years, Grazia's family went through a series of misfortunes, such as the tragic alcoholism of her older brother, the multiple arrests of her younger one and finally the death of her father when she was 21, which left the family in a difficult economical situation.</p>
        <p>Her family was not supportive of her desire to write. </p>
        <p>Still between prose and poetry are, among the first works, Paesaggi sardi, published by Speirani in 1896. In 1900, after having married Palmiro Madesani, she moved to Rome and after the publication of Anime oneste in 1895 and of Il vecchio della montagna in 1900, plus the collaboration with magazines La Sardegna, Piccola rivista and Nuova Antologia, her work began to gain critical interest. She was a very prolific writer publishing, on average, a novel a year.</p>
        <p>In 1926 Deledda received the Nobel Prize in 1926 in Literature after she had been nominated by Henrik Schück, member of the Swedish Academy.</p>
        <blockquote>&#171 She came to be recognized as one of the best young female writers in Italy. But the discovery of Sardinia decidedly belongs to Grazia Deledda. [...] As a painter of nature she has few equals in European literature. She does not uselessly waste her vivid colours; but even then, the nature which she describes has the simple, broad lines of ancient landscapes, as it has their chaste purity and majesty. It is a marvellously lively nature in perfect harmony with the psychological life of her characters. Like a truly great artist, she succeeds in incorporating her representation of people’s sentiments and customs into her descriptions of nature. &#187(from the Nobel Prize Ceremony Speech, 1926) </blockquote>
        ￼<p>Her response in winning the prize was Già! (Already!) </p>
        <p>With this string of fame, came a slew of journalists and notable photographers whom she allowed into her home to learn more about her. Her beloved pet crow, Checcha was irritated by all the commotion with people coming in and out. “If Checcha has had enough, so have I,” Deledda was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p> Deledda was very protective of her daily writing routine. Her schedule was exactly the same seven days a week: a late breakfast, a few hours of reading, lunch followed by a nap and then, clearly, ending the day with a few hours of writing. </p>

        <p>Deledda continued to write even as she grew older and weaker. "La Casa del Poeta" and "Sole d'Estate" are two of the collections of short stories she wrote during this time. She showcased her optimistic view of life even as she suffered from painful illnesses. </p>
        <p>She died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. La chiesa della solitudine (1936), Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with her breast cancer. A completed manuscript of the novel "Cosima" (1937) was discovered after her death and published posthumously.</p>

        <blockquote>«Destiny caused me to be born in the heart of lonely Sardinia. But even if I had been born in Rome or Stockholm, I should not have been different. I should have always been what I am – a soul which becomes impassioned about life’s problems and which lucidly perceives men as they are, while still believing that they could be better and that no one else but themselves prevents them from achieving God’s reign on earth. Everything is hatred, blood, and pain; but, perhaps, everything will be conquered one day by means of love and good will.»</blockquote>
